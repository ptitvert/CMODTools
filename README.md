Misc utility tools for CMOD

* recreate-retr.sh

This is a small utility to recreate a retr directory. First thing it will delete the existing "retr" directory if it exists
in order to have a clean state where to begin.

At the moment, you need to edit the script to give the path of CMOD home installation directory.
Then then usage is quite "easy":

    ./recreate_retr.sh <ODINSTANCE>

As always have a backup if something goes wrong :-D
